[Aaron Moment][aaron-moment] is my personal technique blog.

This blog is hosted by [Github][github] and powered by [Jekyll][jekyll]. [Jekyll][jekyll] is a static site generator that makes it easier to transform plain text into static websites and blogs.

This blog is based on [Jekyll Now][jekyll-now]. It helps create Jekyll blog quickly by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
