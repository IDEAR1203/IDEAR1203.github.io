# Aaron Moment

[Aaron Moment][aaron-moment] is my personal technique blog.

This blog is hosted by [Github][github] and powered by [Jekyll][jekyll]. [Jekyll][jekyll] is a static site generator that make it easier to transform plain text into static websites and blogs.

This blog is based on [Jekyll Now](jekyll-now). It helps create Jekyll blog quickly by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

[Hattle.com][hattle] is an awesome beautiful blog. It has great significance to my blog front-end style.
